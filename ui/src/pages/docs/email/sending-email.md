## Sending email

We can use the [API Client](docs/intro/using-the-api-client.html) to facilitate the process of sending requests to WeDeploy.

In order to send emails, we have to make a `POST` request to `/emails` passing some required parameters like `from`, `to`, and `subject`:

```javascript
WeDeploy
	.url('http://<serviceID>.<projectID>.wedeploy.io/emails')
	.form('from', 'from@domain.com')
	.form('to', 'to@domain.com')
	.form('subject', 'Hi there!')
	.post()
	.then(function(response) {
		console.log('Email ID:', response.body());
	})
	.catch(function(error) {
		// Some error has happened
	});
```
```swift
WeDeploy
	.email('http://<EmailserviceID>.<projectID>.wedeploy.io)
	.sendEmail(from: self.username, to: self.username, subject: "subject", body: "body")
	.then { id in
		print("Email ID: \(id)")
	}
	.catch {
		// Some error has happened
	}
```
```java
WeDeploy
	.email("http://<serviceID>.<projectID>.wedeploy.io/emails")
	.from("from@domain.com")
	.to("to@domain.com")
	.subject("Hi there!")
	.send()
	.execute();
```

As a result, we'll receive an email ID. This doesn't indicate that the email has already sent, it actually just means that it was added to the email queue. See ["checking the email status"](/docs/email/checking-status.html) to learn more about email status.
